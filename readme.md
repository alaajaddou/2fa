# Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) with Authenticator Apps

## Overview

This document outlines the integration of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) using authenticator apps in a web application. The integration enhances security by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication, typically a time-based one-time password (TOTP) generated by an authenticator app.

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Shared Secret**
- A unique secret key is generated for each user.
- The secret is shared between the application and the user's authenticator app.
- This secret is used to generate time-based one-time passwords (TOTPs).

### 2. **QR Code**
- A QR code is generated from the shared secret.
- The QR code is displayed to the user, who scans it with their authenticator app.
- Scanning the QR code configures the app to generate TOTPs for the user.

### 3. **Time-Based One-Time Password (TOTP)**
- TOTPs are temporary codes generated by the authenticator app.
- These codes are valid for a short period (usually 30 seconds).
- The user enters the TOTP during login to verify their identity.

## Integration Steps

### 1. **Backend Integration**
- **Generate a Shared Secret:**  
  The backend generates a unique secret for each user during 2FA setup.

- **Generate a QR Code:**  
  A QR code is created using the shared secret. This QR code encodes the secret in a format that the authenticator app can understand.

- **Store the Shared Secret:**  
  Securely store the shared secret in the user's record in the database.

- **Verify TOTP Codes:**  
  When the user logs in and submits a TOTP, the backend verifies the code against the current time and the stored shared secret.

### 2. **Frontend Integration**
- **Display QR Code:**  
  Provide an interface for users to scan the QR code during the 2FA setup process.

- **Input for 2FA Code:**  
  Create a form where users can input the TOTP generated by their authenticator app during login or sensitive actions.

- **Submit 2FA Code:**  
  Send the TOTP input by the user to the backend for verification.

## User Flow

### 1. **2FA Setup**
- User logs in and navigates to the 2FA setup page.
- Backend generates a shared secret and QR code.
- Frontend displays the QR code.
- User scans the QR code with their authenticator app, configuring it to generate TOTPs.

### 2. **Login with 2FA**
- User logs in with their username and password.
- After successful login, the user is prompted to enter the TOTP generated by their authenticator app.
- User enters the TOTP and submits it.
- Backend verifies the TOTP, and if valid, grants access to the user.

## Security Considerations
- **Secure Storage:**  
  Ensure that the shared secret is stored securely in the backend.

- **Code Expiration:**  
  TOTPs should expire after a short period (e.g., 30 seconds) to minimize the risk of replay attacks.

- **Rate Limiting:**  
  Implement rate limiting on TOTP submissions to prevent brute-force attacks.

- **Backup Codes:**  
  Consider providing users with backup codes that can be used in case they lose access to their authenticator app.

## Conclusion

Integrating 2FA using authenticator apps adds a critical layer of security to your application. By following the steps outlined in this document, you can implement a robust 2FA system that enhances user protection against unauthorized access.
